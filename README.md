# SiegeUI

## Summary
SiegeUI is an SDL2 based UI library for .NET/.NET Standard.

It's being built to enable development of applications that require custom and visually complex components  without much impact to the end user.

This library allows the developer to build a .NET app in a very WinForms-esque way (minus the form designer, for now).

It's very much under development - feel free to poke around the source.
